Shout outs to SpaceBoiStreams, without their sonic music mod, I wouldn't have gone down the path of learning how to modify the games event scripts to give more unique battle themes. Also the sonic music pack is great.

This music mod does not replace cutscene tracks, only adds one
as well as currently, The gummi ship routes/Atlantica/Hundred Acre Wood are unchanged
